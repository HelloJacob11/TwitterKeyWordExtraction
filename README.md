# Twitter Keyword Extraction

This project analyzes tweets in real-time, identifying keywords associated with "Democrat" or "Republican" to uncover patterns in political discourse. The program processes 1,000 tweets per minute, traversing through user-generated content to extract meaningful insights from related tweets.


## Overview

This program aims to extract relevant keywords associated with political terms ("Democrat" and "Republican") from Twitter data. By analyzing the tweets of users who mention these terms, the project provides a deeper understanding of commonly associated topics and discussions.

## Project Duration

**May 2022 - September 2022**

## Programming Language

The primary programming language for this project is Python.

## Dataset

Tweets were collected through the Twitter API, filtered for content mentioning "Democrat" or "Republican," and further processed for analysis.

## Key Features

### Collecting Tweets

* Processes up to 1,000 tweets per minute.
* Filters tweets mentioning "Democrat" or "Republican."
* Retrieves additional tweets from the same user for keyword extraction.

### TF Keyword Extraction
Here’s the detailed version of those three sections:

#### Filtering Stop Words

The program implements a stop word removal process to enhance the quality of extracted keywords. Stop words are commonly used words (e.g., "the," "and," "of") that do not contribute significant meaning to text analysis. By filtering these words, the algorithm ensures that the extracted keywords are more contextually relevant to the user's tweets.

The stop word filtering process is carried out as follows:

1. **Stop Word List:** A predefined list of stop words is used, which includes common words from the English language. This list can be customized based on the analysis requirements.
2. **Tokenization:** Tweets are split into individual words (tokens).
3. **Comparison and Removal:** Each word is compared against the stop word list, and matching words are removed.

This ensures that only meaningful and unique words are retained for further analysis, improving the accuracy of keyword extraction.

#### Stemming & Lemmatizing

To maintain consistency across variations of words, the program utilizes stemming and lemmatizing techniques:

1. **Stemming:** This involves reducing words to their base or root form by removing suffixes. For example:

   * "running," "runner," and "ran" → "run"
   * "talked," "talking," and "talks" → "talk"

2. **Lemmatizing:** Unlike stemming, lemmatizing ensures that the reduced word is a valid dictionary word. For example:

   * "better" → "good"
   * "children" → "child"

Both processes are applied using natural language processing (NLP) libraries, such as NLTK or SpaCy. By normalizing words, the program eliminates redundant variations, ensuring more accurate keyword associations and analysis.

#### Random Words

The random sampling approach is implemented through a custom method designed to uncover unique word patterns. This process involves:

1. **Input Data Preparation:** A text file (`randomWords.txt`) is used as input, containing categorized word lists organized in blocks.
2. **Categorization:** Words are grouped into separate lists based on specific characteristics (e.g., semantic similarity or thematic relevance).
3. **Random Selection:** For each group, a word is randomly selected using Python's `random.choice()` function.
